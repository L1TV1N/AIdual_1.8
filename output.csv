такой отличный анекдот
for will avoid the pole
"Yes, he hears some kind of mooing, it’s incomprehensible, but the hare cheerfully and cheerfully runs out from behind a bush, as you say, and there is a trap, and a wolf’s face is caught in the trap, but"
"the wolf's tail comes up, he pulled him up, he sang, he tore him off properly, he came, he gave it to me, and he's also handsome, and even the wolf there just went crazy, he tore his face out of this trap, he's rushing, I'll catch up with him, I'll tear him apart"
hears the chase see the swamp jumped the swamp from the swamp you know the muzzle stuck out from the wear and tear such a conclusion on the shore is only a beaver
you haven't seen the hare
I speed Romeo don't talk
Ha
